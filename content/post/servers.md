There's something nice about having a physical server. Whether it's a raspberry pi, old pc, overly smart router, or some other device, having your own server to manage and a small set of services or apps to keep up make a hobby out of syst
em administration and/or development that nicely creates a sense of responsibility and set of small problems to keep one on one's toes.

Work with what you have...

Or don't and buy what you don't need.

Play.

It's all good.

Making some sort of hobby out of computers is one of the most rewarding things in a world that is consistently heading towards a digital future.

Make that digital future a little more human...
